# Welcome to EverythingLibrary!

# :hammer: WORK IN PROGRESS AHEAD :wrench:

## This is the backend side of things :3

EverythingLibrary is a simple web app to save and share collections of anything and **Everything** (;3)

It comes with a simple byt efficient tag-based search tool.

## The main goal of this project is to be extremely easy to set up on your own!

the first working release goal is to create an app that anyone, no matter the experience can set up and customize in one day

to that end, video guides will be created later!
